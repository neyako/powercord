# Nord-Glasscord

# My Changes
- Use native titlebar
- Use `SF Pro Display` font (has to be installed on the system, [`otf-san-francisco` on the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/otf-san-francisco/))
- Use [2 Columns](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/ServerColumns)
- Add [Settings icons](https://github.com/snappercord/Settings-Icons)
- Add [Codeblock icons](https://github.com/snappercord/codeblock-icons)
- Powercord compatibility
- Use [JoyPixels emojis](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/EmojiReplace)
- Remove obsolete code

## Installation

### BetterDiscord
Drop the `nord-glasscord.theme.css` in your `themes` folder
(⚠️ You won't get updates)

### Powercord
Open your `themes` folder and `git clone https://github.com/D3SOX/Nord-Glasscord.git`

## Original Readme
This is a modification of AryToNeX's Glasscord: https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord.
It simply combines several themes and makes them work with Glasscord to conform to the Nord Theme color palette:
https://www.nordtheme.com/

INSTRUCTIONS:
Start by installing BandagedBD: https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases. Then, follow the instructions on the Glasscord page (scroll down): https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord to install ONLY the .asar file for Glasscord (found under releases). Then, INSTEAD OF installing Glasscord's discord_example.theme.css file, download nord-glasscord.theme.css from this repository/fork to your BetterDiscord/themes folder (themes folder can be opened from the Themes page of your BandagedBD Discord settings). Finally, enable it in the Themes page of BandagedBD, and enjoy!

I also recommend the https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/EditChannels plugin to customize channel text color.

Only tested with BandagedBD. Use at your own risk, though I haven't run into any problems. Good luck, and please enjoy!
